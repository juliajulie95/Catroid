# GSoC documentation Julia Herold
My Summer of Code project was the redesign and implementation of the app's landing page.
At first I planned and designed the layout. The goal was to make the landing page more modern and user-friendly, 
but also to incorporate the webview of https://share.catrob.at/app/.
